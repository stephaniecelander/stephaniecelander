## Welcome to my eProtfolio

Hello. My name is Stephanie Celander. I am a student at Southern New Hampshire University working on my computer science degree. As part of my projects, I have created a website to use as my eProtfolio. You can see my work [here](https://laughable-clerk.000webhostapp.com/index.html).
