            Hello. I am Stephanie Celander. I live in Joliet, IL with my four children and variety of animals. I currently work as a stay at home mom to my children and devote my time to managing a family of five, managing my kids e-learning, working on completing my college degree and career change. I also breed, raise and train competitive dressage horses.
            </p>
            
            <p style="font-family:optima; color: white; text-indent: 50px; font-size:160%">
            In my free time I enjoy riding my horses, running and bike riding. When I do have downtime, I am usually planning my next home improvment project or our next trip to Disney World. I also foster and train non-adoptable animals. I love to give a chance to those who others have given up on.  
            </p>
       
            
             <p style="font-family:optima; color: white; text-indent: 50px; font-size:160%">
             I previously attended Univeristy of Findlay where I worked on an associates degree for equestrian science and equestrian business managment. After years of being a stay at home mom and many life changes, I decided to enroll in Southern New Hampshire University to work on a degree in computer science. With this degree, I plan on pursue a career as a Scrum Master or project leader.
