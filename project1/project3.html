                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">For my third artifact I was to pick something to show off what I have learned about databases. Throughout my classes at Southern New Hampshire University, I learned the basics of SQL and MongoDB. In my CS-340 class I worked on MongoDB and coded in Python. I decided for this project I would convert the python codes to java.
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">Coding is not a strong point of mine. It is something that I continue to work on and am constantly trying to improve. I will admit, I am better at working with Python than Java so this was a struggle for me. This was challenging but I feel like I learned a lot through researching the codes. </p>
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">I did not find a lot of help online finding the CRUD codes for Java and MongoDB as I was finding them most in Python. I ended up working off of the examples I found. I found this to be tricky as every tutorial example did things slightly differently. I had to get creative in trying to get my code to match up. Overall, I learned the format of MongoDB in java but I think if I work with a Mongo database in the future, I will stick to coding it in Python.</p>
