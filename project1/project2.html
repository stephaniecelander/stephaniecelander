                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">For my second project in my eProtfolio, I was to focus on data structures and algorithms. A class that taught me a lot about this is class CS-260, rightfully called Data Structures and Algorithms. I enjoyed this class and felt I learned so much. 
                            </p>
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">Data structures and algorithms the core of programming. It is the way data is organized, stored and used. Without these two concepts, there is no way to have a program. Because of this, I had a really hard time trying to pick out a project that would showcase my skills. I decided work on a topic rather than a project.</p>
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">For this project I chose to focus on tree structures. When I think of tree structures, I picture a family tree. There is a root node and from there, parent nodes and children nodes branch off. This may only be a few nodes up to indefinite amounts but it all connects back to that root node. </p>
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">This is really helpful when calling on information. Take for example a dictionary. The dictionary is the root node. From there, there are many words, which are parent nodes, and there are definitions which are children nodes. One word may have three different meanings. In order find those definitions, you just search for that word and all of the definitions will come up saving you time than searching through all of the words. </p>
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">I used python language in MongoDB to create my tree structures. I never created tree structures in a database so while this may not seem complicated to some, it did research and trial and error on my part.</p>
