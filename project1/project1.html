I used html/css that I learned in my IT-270: Website Design class. When thinking back to when I started messing around with computers the most, it was mostly website design. In grade school I used to design my own webpages for fun with friends and in high school it was cool to have our own online blogs. At that point it was always cut and paste codes off of google and finding cool fonts and effects to add to the page. </p> 
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">Throughout my IT-270 class, I really learned about the technicality and precision that goes into making sites. Cohesiveness, user-friendly and relevance are all things to think about when creating sites. While I am still learning a lot, trial and error are my best teachers right now. </p>
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">I built my site for my eProtfolio from scratch. I spent the most time out of all of my artifacts working on it. While there are still some things I need to figure out, such as the website does not scale well between different computers and screen sizes, overall, I am really proud of how far I have come.
