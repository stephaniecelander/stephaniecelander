                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">Hello. I am Stephanie Celander. My journey to where I am now has been a long and hard path but I am hoping it is well worth it. School has never really been my thing. I was always just getting by in classes and spending all of my free time at a dance studio or riding my horses. When it was time for college, I chose the most logical to me. I attended University of Findlay and majored in equestrian science. I always loved horses and dedicated all of my time to learning as much as I could so going to college for that just seemed logical. Well long story short, after two years I decided to move back home, get a job and try to figure out life. </p>
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">After I came home from college, I did what I thought I was supposed to do. learned to work with horses from breeding all of the way to training show quality horses and selling them. I ran a successful summer camp program for kids wanting to learn more about horses and I taught beginner riding lessons. I also worked other jobs such as bartending, back office jobs and nannying for children. I was finally figuring out life and then I got married and had a few kids.</p>
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">At 34 years old I was in a position I needed to find a new way of life. After a being a stay at home mom for 10 years and a divorce I felt lost. I had no decent work experience in those ten years and was left to raise my four young kids by myself and figure out how I will succeed at providing for them. Working with horses is what I knew but there is a saying that the only way to make money in horses is to start off with more than you want to make. I needed something more stable. After exploring a lot of options, I decided to go back to school to work with computers. I hoped going into the computer world would give me the stability and flexibility I needed for my kids.</p> 
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">When entering the program and Southern New Hampshire University, I had no idea what direction I wanted to go into. I just knew that in high school I had so much fun messing around with website design and I thought something like cyber security would be interesting. As I worked through classes I slowly weeded out what I was not good at. After a class in game design, I knew that was not for me. It gave me a whole new respect for people who create games and how difficult and in-depth it can be. While I like to code and slowly became better at it, the idea of becoming a programmer did not appeal to me either. While I will continue to work on improving my coding skills, I do not think it is a strength of mine at the moment. What did interest me was my html/css class and other design type classes. I really got interested in Agile and Scrum and decided this is more the path I want to pursue.</p>
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em; overflow: scroll">While raising my four kids alone, volunteering as a foster parent for unadoptable animals and still working with horses, I have become a very organized person. I have learned to be able to communicate well with people and keep everyone focused on what they need to get done. My life is one big swirl of multi-tasking and I love it. I thrive on being busy and being organized. My favorite thing in the world is helping others succeed. I do not need the praise or the thanks, I get that when I put everything I can into helping everyone. This is why Scrum Master appealed to me. Once I started learning about the software development lifecycle and about agile and different roles, I felt like I could finally fit into something in the tech world. As I have been working through my schoolwork, when I have free time late at night, I am usually studying more about becoming a Scrum Master.</p>
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">One thing I always struggled with is working on teams when I am not in the same location as the person. In the past, I would tend to take more leadership roles and work through everything myself when I am not working within the team directly. One of the classes I took at SNHU focused on working with other people through projects in GitHub. I was worried about this class. It was the class that gave me the most anxiety because I felt I was not as experiences as others since I was new to this career path while others were more experienced. However, once I started reviewing codes and adding to it and seeing others comments on my work, I really started to enjoy this class. I learned a lot about how it does not matter the experience level of the programmer, you can learn from everyone. Every person on the team has something to bring to the table and every person can also learn something new from each other. Whether it is more experienced programmers learning a newer way of doing something or a less experienced programmer getting helpful tips and tricks from the pros. Now as everyone is working more remotely these days, I feel very comfortable taking a job where I may never work directly with my teammates. </p>
                            <p style="color:white; font-size:35%; text-align: left; text-indent: 2.0em">Overall, I came into this program as a complete blank slate. I really had no clue what I was ahead. With no previous work experience with computers, I have come such a long way. While I still do not feel comfortable coding an app by myself, I do feel confident in testing codes, peer reviews and coding in blocks to create a bigger project. I have some experience with different databases now that I am continuing to learn about and improve my skills. I even have some basic knowledge of coding graphics which I never imagined I would learn. I have really impressed myself as I have gone through this program and I feel comfortable now as I start searching for jobs.
